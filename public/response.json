                        "text": "The Global Internal Audit Standards emphasize maintaining independence and objectivity through several principles and standards.\n\n**Principle 2: Maintain Objectivity**\nInternal auditors must maintain an impartial and unbiased attitude when performing internal audit services and making decisions. Objectivity is an unbiased mental attitude that allows internal auditors to make professional judgments, fulfill their responsibilities, and achieve the Purpose of Internal Auditing without compromise. An independently positioned internal audit function supports internal auditors’ ability to maintain objectivity [1].\n\n**Standard 2.1 Individual Objectivity**\nInternal auditors must maintain professional objectivity when performing all aspects of internal audit services. This requires applying an impartial and unbiased mindset and making judgments based on balanced assessments of all relevant circumstances. Internal auditors must be aware of and manage potential biases [1].\n\n**Standard 2.2 Safeguarding Objectivity**\nInternal auditors must recognize and avoid or mitigate actual, potential, and perceived impairments to objectivity. They must not accept any tangible or intangible item, such as a gift, reward, or favor, that may impair or be presumed to impair objectivity [1].\n\n**Standard 7.1 Organizational Independence**\nThe chief audit executive must document in the internal audit charter the reporting relationships and organizational positioning of the internal audit function, as determined by the board. This includes ensuring the internal audit function is positioned at a level within the organization that enables it to perform its services and responsibilities without interference [10].\n\n**Disclosure of Impairments to Objectivity**\nInternal auditors must recognize and avoid or mitigate actual, potential, and perceived impairments to objectivity [1]. The chief audit executive must establish methodologies to address impairments to objectivity, and internal auditors must discuss impairments and take appropriate actions according to relevant methodologies [10]. Examples of evidence of conformance include documented disclosures of potential conflicts of interest or other impairments to objectivity [1]. The chief audit executive must also discuss with the board and senior management any current or proposed roles and responsibilities that have the potential to impair the internal audit function’s independence, either in fact or appearance, and advise them of the types of safeguards to manage these impairments [10].\n\n<br>\n**References:**\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxIGpHQCKg5aGb_Ad18A0dLbTuwlsL8g/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxIGpHQCKg5aGb_Ad18A0dLbTuwlsL8g/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxIGpHQCKg5aGb_Ad18A0dLbTuwlsL8g/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">5</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">7</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">8</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxIGpHQCKg5aGb_Ad18A0dLbTuwlsL8g/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">9</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXFyNXHsFe-0TPOPXIM4Pgd7q3ezRBk/view?usp=drivesdk\" target=\"_blank\">10</a>"

The Standards apply to any individual or function that \r\nprovides internal audit services, whether an organization employs internal auditors directly, contracts them \r\nthrough an external service provider, or both. Organizations receiving internal audit services vary in sector \r\nand industry affiliation, purpose, size, complexity, and structure. \r\nFor Personal Use Only8 ©2024, The Institute of Internal Auditors. All Rights Reserved. \r\nFor individual personal use only.\r\nFundamentals of the Global Internal Audit Standards\r\nThe Standards apply to the internal audit function and individual internal auditors including the chief audit \r\nexecutive. While the chief audit executive is accountable for the internal audit function’s implementation of \r\nand conformance with all principles and standards, all internal auditors are responsible for conforming with \r\nthe principles and standards relevant to performing their job responsibilities, which are presented primarily in \r\nDomain II: Ethics and Professionalism and Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services. \r\nThe Standards are organized into five domains:\r\n• Domain I: Purpose of Internal Auditing.\r\n• Domain II: Ethics and Professionalism.\r\n• Domain III: Governing the Internal Audit Function.\r\n• Domain IV: Managing the Internal Audit Function.\r\n• Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services.\r\nDomains II through V contain the following elements:\r\n• Principles: broad descriptions of a related group of requirements and considerations.\r\n• Standards, which include: \r\n– Requirements: mandatory practices for internal auditing. \r\n– Considerations for Implementation: common and preferred practices to consider when \r\nimplementing the requirements. \r\n– Examples of Evidence of Conformance: ways to demonstrate that the requirements of the \r\nStandards have been implemented.\r\nThe Standards use the word “must” in the Requirements sections and the words “should” and “may” to \r\nspecify common and preferred practices in the Considerations for Implementation sections. Each \r\nstandard ends with a list of examples of evidence. The examples are neither requirements nor the only \r\nways to demonstrate conformance; rather, they are provided to help internal audit functions prepare for \r\nquality assessments, which rely on demonstrative evidence. The Standards use certain terms as defined \r\nin the accompanying glossary. To understand and implement the Standards correctly, it is necessary to \r\nunderstand and adopt the specific meanings and usage of the terms as described in the glossary.\r\nDemonstrating Conformance with the Standards\r\nThe requirements, considerations for implementation, and examples of evidence of conformance are \r\ndesigned to help internal auditors conform with the Standards. While conformance with the requirements \r\nis expected, internal auditors occasionally may be unable to conform with a requirement yet still achieve \r\nthe intent of the standard. Circumstances that may necessitate adjustments are often related to resource \r\nlimitations or specific aspects of a sector, industry, and/or jurisdiction. In these exceptional circumstances,\r\nalternative actions should be implemented to meet the intent of the related standard. The chief audit \r\nexecutive is responsible for documenting and conveying the rationale for the deviation and the adopted \r\nalternative actions to the appropriate parties. Related requirements and information appear in Standard 4.1 \r\nConformance with Global Internal Audit Standards and Domain III: Governing the Internal Audit Function \r\ntogether with its principles and standards.",
